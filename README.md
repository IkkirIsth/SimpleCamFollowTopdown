# SimpleCamFollowTopdown
A really simple camera for followig a character from top down

Adapted from a prototype I made for a top-down dungeon crawler, this simple camera motion script follows a set target at a specified zoom distance, and can zoom in and out as necessary.

To use: 

Simply change the line that gets your player follow transform target, then hook your joystick input in your controller script into the camera, and adjust appropriately.
